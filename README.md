# Google Hash Code 2022 Qualification round
This repository contains our source code as a solution to Google Hash Code 2022 Qualification competition. 

We've ended up at 4705th place with 44,670 points, which is nearly 1% of what the best team achieved. I know that it's nothing we should brag about, but this repository functions mainly as an archive of our code. Our original code is published on [another](https://github.com/makiprogrammer/hash-code-2022/tree/our-solution-on-competition-day) branch in this repository.

However, we gave the problem a second chance and fixed the majority of our bugs. Since the organisators have disabled Judge system (we now only get OK/WA answear), we wrote our own evaluator for the puspose of self-evaluation. We cannot guarantee the flawlessness of the evaluator, but it determined that we would have ended with something like 2,700,000 points, which is quite a jump I suppose - equivalent to 64% of what the best team achieved. 

Note: there is also [stats.py](https://github.com/makiprogrammer/hash-code-2022/blob/main/stats.py) file which was used for algorithm profiling.
